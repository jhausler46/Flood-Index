#Flood Index

Our program is a flood index calculator that takes river gauge height and max river height during a flood event to calculate an index and plot the gauges and their index value in ArcGIS Pro. The index allows the user to compare different areas of flood severity against the average flood severity of a single event. Possible users for this program would be any public agency looking to compare flood severity from a flood event in their area.
